        To add a new name, syllable or pattern just click on the \"+\" button in the bottom right
        corner of the lists.\n\n

        To show the edit and delete buttons of a name, syllable or pattern simply swipe from right
        to left on the desired entry. This will hide the \"+\" button, so to show it again swipe
        from left to right on the entry.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_patterns">
        Patterns can contain fixed items but must always contain at least one syllable-part.\n\n
        A syllable-part has to start with a \"{\" and end with a \"}\".\n\n
        The first character of it must be either \"X\", \"C\" or \"V\". This determines if the
        first syllable should start with a consonant (C), a vowel (V) or if it can be random (X).
        Setting this character to lowercase or uppercase also sets the first character of the
        starting syllable to lowercase or uppercase.\n\n
        Then follows the amount of used syllables. Either set a fixed number between \"1\" and \"9\"
        or set a range between \"1-1\" to \"9-9\".\n\n
        Outside of these syllable parts, you can add anything you like and it will be added to the
        generated parts.\n\n\n\n

        To understand the previous text a bit better, I will explain what the patterns provided
        at installation will do.\n\n

        \"{X2-9}\" will generate names starting with an uppercase random syllable and these names
        will contain between 2 and 9 syllables.\n\n

        \"{V1} {C1}\'{c1-4}\" will generate names starting with one uppercase syllable that has a
        vowel as first character.\n
        Then follows a static blank space.\n
        Then one uppercase syllable that starts with a consonant will follow, directly followed by
        a static apostrophe.\n
        The last syllable-part will add a lowercase consonant syllable and will contain between 1
        and 4 syllables in total.
