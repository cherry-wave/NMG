        "Generator\n\n"

        "Swipe down to generate names. Check the right boxes to save your favourites. You have to "
        "scroll to the top and then swipe down again to generate new names. The bottom bar can be "
        "used to set how many unique names should be generated on one swipe.\n\n\n\n"

        "Adding new names, syllables or patterns\n\n"

        "To add a new entry, just click on the \"+\" button in the bottom right corner of the lists.\n\n\n\n"

        "Edit or delete names, syllables or patterns\n\n"

        "To show the edit and delete buttons of an entry, simply swipe from right to left on the "
        "desired line. This will hide the \"+\" button, so swipe from left to right if you want "
        "to return.\n\n\n\n"

        "Patterns\n\n"

        "Patterns can contain fixed items but must always contain at least one syllable-part.\n\n"
        "A syllable-part has to start with a \"{\" and end with a \"}\".\n\n"
        "The first character of it must be either \"X\", \"C\" or \"V\". This determines if the "
        "first syllable should start with a consonant (C), a vowel (V) or if it can be random (X). "
        "Setting this character to lowercase or uppercase also sets the first character of the "
        "starting syllable to lowercase or uppercase.\n\n"
        "Then follows the amount of used syllables. Either set a fixed number between \"1\" and \"9\" "
        "or set a range between \"1-1\" to \"9-9\".\n\n"
        "Outside of these syllable parts, you can add anything you like and it will be added to the "
        "generated parts.\n\n\n\n"

        "Pattern examples\n\n"

        "To understand the previous text a bit better, I will explain what the patterns provided "
        "at installation will do.\n\n"
        "\"{X2-9}\" will generate names starting with an uppercase random syllable and these names "
        "will contain between 2 and 9 syllables.\n\n"
        "\"{V1} {C1}'{c1-4}\" will generate names starting with one uppercase syllable that has a "
        "vowel as first character.\n"
        "Then follows a static blank space.\n"
        "Then one uppercase syllable that starts with a consonant will follow, directly followed by "
        "a static apostrophe.\n"
        "The last syllable-part will add a lowercase consonant syllable and will contain between 1 "
        "and 4 syllables in total."
