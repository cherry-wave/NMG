# No Man's Generator

I created this android app to give me some inspiration on planet and creature names in No Man's Sky.

Of course it can be used for other lore too ;)

The app generates names out of a syllable base. You can save generated names and afterwards edit/tag/delete them or even add your own names right away.

The app provides a set of syllables on install. You can add/delete/edit and activate/deactivate them.
