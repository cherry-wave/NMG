# No Man's Generator

This is an unofficial android app for Hello Games' "No Man's Sky"

I created this app to give me some inspiration on planet and creature names.

Of course it can be used for other lore too ;)

The app generates names out of a syllable base. You can save generated names and afterwards edit/delete them or even add your own names right away.

The app provides a set of syllables on install. You can add/delete/edit and activate/deactivate them.

For adventurous people, the patterns with which the names are generated are editable too!
